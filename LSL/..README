			   LSL Handbook, Version 3.1
			       December 8, 1999

This directory contains (minor revisions of) the traits in the LSL Handbook,
which appears in Appendix A of ``Larch: Languages and Tools for Formal
Specification'' by John V. Guttag and James J. Horning with S. J. Garland,
K. D. Jones, A. Modet, and J. M. Wing, Springer-Verlag, 1993.

The following revisions have been made to the traits in this directory.

1.  Several axiomatizations have been corrected or reformulated.
    (a) AbelianMonoid.lsl (page 199)
        Added "implies AC".
    (b) Boolean.lsl (page 161)
        Added "AC(<=>)" to the implications.
    (c) DerivedOrders.lsl (page 195)
        Moved the first assertion to the implications.
    (d) Integer.lsl (pages 163-164)
        Corrected the second implied equation to "x <= y == x < succ(y)"
        (originally, the "<" and "<=" relations were interchanged).
    (e) Sequence.lsl (page 174)
        Corrected the definition of "find" by treating the empty sequence as a
        special case.

2.  Several changes reflect new syntax in Version 3.1 of the LSL checker.
    (a) The equality symbol "==" has been eliminated by replacing it with
        "=" or "<=>".
    (b) The propositions "S generated/partitioned by" have been amended to
        "sort S generated/partitioned by".
    (c) Notations for parameterized types have been introduced in Array1.lsl, 
        Array2.lsl, ArraySlice2.lsl, Bag.lsl, BagBasics.lsl, BinaryTree.lsl, 
	ChoiceBag.lsl, ChoiceSet.lsl, ComposeMaps.lsl, Deque.lsl, 
	FiniteMap.lsl, List.lsl, ListStructure.lsl, ListStructureOps.lsl,
	PriorityQueue.lsl, Queue.lsl, Sequence.lsl, Set.lsl, SetBasics.lsl,
	Stack.lsl, StackBasics.lsl, String.lsl

3.  Formal parameters have been added to IndexOp.lsl, JoinOp.lsl, and
    MemberOp.lsl.

4.  Minor, logically equivalent changes have been made in the formulation of
    an axiom in ArithOps.lsl and Deque.lsl.

5.  Minor changes have been made in the wording of some comments.


This directory also a revised version, lslinit.lsi, or the LSL init file
described in Appendix C of the book by Guttag and Horning.  This file
customizes the lexical syntax of the LSL Checker.


For the LSL Checker to find the files in this directory, the Unix environment
variable LARCH_PATH should be defined to include this directory, e.g., by
	setenv LARCH_PATH .:/usr/local/lib/LSL
